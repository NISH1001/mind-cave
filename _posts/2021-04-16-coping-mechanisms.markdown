### I)

Not sure. I have been on a long hiatus to actually write proses. [0] If I wasn't, it'd be the same old rut of emptiness and loneliness, and "Kafkaesque"ness of everything. Surely, I am cognitively biased to see only the "peak" and the "end" of all....but sometimes I wish I had a companion to whom I can talk about nothing and everything late at night. Writing had always been one of a few coping mechanisms for me. Now since I have avoided taking medics for 3+ months now, I am sure I can feel a lot better if I keep on not giving a damn about anything. Yet, A BIT YET. I am not sure if this long-lasting depression will be the end of me. It took a really BIG courage to stop caring about everything.


### II)

It's evident that struggle is eternal, and in that struggle, we tend to keep on phasing in and out through metamorphosis. [[Change is inevitable]]. Sometimes a small change makes you "satisfied" with whatever you did. And sometimes you fail to realize that [satisfaction doesn't necessarily give rise to happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0ilA4tjJ0). [[Hedonic Treadmill]] has always been strong; we stream through time, endlessly browsing through memories and wishes we thought we could nourish for eternity.

Sometimes eternity is tiny. And sometimes tiny moments are eternal. Horizontal [spans of life](https://bitsandparadoxes.substack.com/p/bits-and-paradoxes-13) continues indefinitely.

I am sure I am not going anywhere with these absurd streams of thoughts. My hands are too fast for my mind. My laptop can't seem to cope with its user's fluctuations in mood. I wonder if it had a certain level of consciousness, what would it advise me to do. I wonder how my Guitar Rusty feels about me when I, sometimes, go into an orgasmic state with music.


### III)


Music. Aaaah. Another coping mechanism. I wonder how people in my circle feel about the music I write. I am sure most of them hesitate to even say, "Hey, N! Your music suck. Your writing suck." Probably they are right, or at least "correct" in my [[Mind-Cave]]'s simulation.

Probably, I have to halt this lonely train heading into a lonely station somewhere; somewhere a lonely heart stops and casually walks on another treadmill!
