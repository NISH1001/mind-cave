There's a big void in my chest

It's growinâ€™

#### It's growing

### It's GROWING

## It's GROWING


---


I sit still wrapped in my headphone

But there isn't any core

Inside of me

Where the heart used to be

I wonder what has happened to it.


---


Fragments of absurdities

Inside somewhere.

Oh no!

There's no "where".

There isn't even "any".

But I am sure,

The void is growing

The blowing

Breeze passes right through it

In the absence of knowns that were unknowns

That used to fill it up with **meanings**.

Oh wait!

What's even the point?

There's no "meaning".

There's no point.

There's no space.

Axioms fail inside

The void is growing.

I let it be...

Feels like a black hole

Radiating hallucinations

Separating the particles

That make out with me

Broken kisses

and memorable hisses

Are now unknown frequencies

From the past that shall not be

The future that doesn't glee

The void is growing


---


The void is filled with weird music

I am trippin' through the bassline

As if I am tethered to something

Oh wait!

There isn't **"something"**.

There isn't **"some"**.

Only the remaining of a cone

Where the time is stuck

Trying to drip through

But,

The void is bottomless

With an eternal flow that can't drip.

It's growing.

It's growing.

It's growling.....

...and...Hissing...
