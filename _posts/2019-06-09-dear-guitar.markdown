Dear Guitar,  
Missing me?
I know you are.  
But I am not  
Wait! Maybe just a little!  
  
Without you,  
My mind has become a  rot  
Sitting here  
Alone in this room  
In a foreign nation  
I miss your creation  
All the rhythms and the motions  
Music without explanation  
And the subtle orgasm  
While I touched your curves  
Those local maximas  
And the minimas  
The hypnotic  
And yet frightening  
Notes....  
That everyone chokes  
  
  
Dear Guitar,  
I know you are not sitar  
And I am not  your normal player  
Maybe! Just a little.  
Today I am farther  
Today you are cleaner  
You are there  
Closed up in a box  
That noone gives a fuck  
Today! You are in a rot  
All rusty! All dirty!  
Like a bird in a cage  
With all the rage  
I know!  
You don't have the stage!  
RIght now!  
I am here!  
Thinking about those moments!  
The deafening music  
The passionate love  
The anger with my finger  
The silences that were clearer  
The frustration that were dearer  
  
Remember! I remember!  
The first time I collected those money with figures!  
Bought you  
Took away from the musical prostitution.  
Damn you!  
Together we sat in my room  
Boom!  
That was the beginning of a journey!  
Untold story  
Unwritten sorcery  
An unmatched mastery  
Remember! Just Remember!  
The young me when I broke you!  
I was trying to play a solo!  
But you gave up.  
You cranked up!  
Finally! snapped!  
That B string  
Time to fix!  
Repairing you was hard  
With all the shards  
In my backyard  
Fitting in a new string  
Was like an operation  
I didn't demand  
Forceful was my hand  
It wasn't planned  
But you could withstand  
After few minutes  
You were up and running  
And so was my mind!  
Finally...  
We finished that solo together!  
  
Dear Guitar,  
RIght now  
I don't have you  
I am caged up in this room!  
Hey buddy!  
It's been a long time  
A long long time  
That we haven't rhymed  
We haven't hummed  
We haven't jammed!  
Haven't seen anyone here  
You friends aren't here!  
Just few days back!  
Saw the flute!  
But it was mute!  
And just nothing!  
I miss waking up in the middle of the night  
With all the tension and the fright!  
And playing with you  
A little low  
Writing the notes down  
From my dream  
I feared but owned  
Those were rear!  
But the notes were clear!  
Eventually! It'd be a habit!  
Playing at midnight  
Like a demonic ritual  
For an individual  
The music were residual  
  
  


Hey man!  
I think my hand has become rusty!  
I cannot see the skins coming out  
It has become too soft!  
Just like my heart!  
I am imagining me and you  
With all those blues  
And hard rock  
I bet I have forgotten  
The songs we played together  
The music we practiced  and composed  
Like a meditation  
Just have patience!  
I will return  
And unlock that cage  
Then you can unleash that rage!
