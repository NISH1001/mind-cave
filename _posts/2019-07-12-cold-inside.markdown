*It's cloudy and dark and raining*

This poem is also made as a song here in my channel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXCi79JQxrQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXCi79JQxrQ){:class="paradox"}.

It's cold in the morning  
The sun is dying  
The sky is crying  
The cloud is smoking  
The dog is sleeping  
The bird is silent  
The street is muddy  
The bike is shivering  
The kid is jumping, playing.  


My eyes are gazing  
Out of the broken window  
My heart is aching  
As it is thinking  
My head feels heavy  
My mind is lonely  
The emotions are flooding  
The words are freezing  
My ears are listening  
The thoughts are echoing  
Her memories are lurking  
To emptiness that's diving in  
My sanity is fading  
The darkness is coming  
The songs are mocking  
The music is saddening  

It's cold inside of me  
My heart's pounding hurriedly  
My anxieties are growing  
As her memories hallucinate me  


It's cold inside of me  
My breathe is shortening  
The coffee is evaporating  
As her memories intoxicate me
