Walking — calmly and slowly  
Letting go of all the hustle  
Aimlessly kissing  
The time and the street beneath  
Where lies pain and misery  
Of life among the history  
A step I take  
**“Tak Tak”** — the sound of the city  
I see people lurking  
With greed and lust  
Where hopes are crushed  
Behind the mask of trust  


As the gentle breeze passes by  
All I can hear is “money”  
Where life rumbles in agony  
Not of suffering  
But the voices — all suppressed  
And “People” inside a soul-less thing  
With all the corruption  
Within the lifeless emotions  
Some lives living  
Some starting to live  
Some struggling and stumbling  


As I wander, often  
Something follows me behind  
Not a shadow but a timeless being  
Among the silent noises  
That fill the streets  
With hopes and despair  
With trust and care  
With living and the dead  
With “rights” and rituals  
With face and curious minds  


Walking, running, crawling  
As I feel the screams  
Of survival dreams  
On these streets  
Where people laugh  
And hatred thrives  
Where poor nap  
A child without mother’s lap  
Where children play  
And diseased lay  
Where money talks  
With the curse  
Of a soul  
Living in fear  


As I wake up   
On the streets  
Where darkness  
Upholds the light  
Life speaks  
Time lies  
Patience falls  
Endurance poisons  
The streets beneath  
Haunted by **me**
