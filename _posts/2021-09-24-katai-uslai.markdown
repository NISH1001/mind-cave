Just listened to Bipul Chettri's [katai uslai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb6Ndo0WyVg).

This is so beautiful... 

It hits hard...like really really hard...like a plane crashing in my heart...in my soul...

At first I thought it was a yearning for a romantic love...but then i realized it's a yearning for a life...for memories...for time...

I am crying now. Fuck.

Somewhere my broken dreams...broken soul is drenched in memories of someone...my past self... of the indefiniteness of life that lies ahead.


## 21:47

This is so beautiful! As the clock passes by the number 42 right by 5 minutes at 9 pm right now, the song repeats like an incoming tsunami, each wave getting bigger and bigger. Stronger emotions.

I hadn't expected to be this much lost in my mind-cave tonight. It's now an avalanche...as if a plane crashed into the cold icebergs in my soul.

If you find my lost soul, please just tell it to not think much, to not think much, to not think much. It might be trying to live somewhere
in the icey-ness of an unknown cave covered by the avalanche!

The video has this universal representation of our feelings and emotions, captured through a relatable theatre...

For the entirety I was expecting (and still expecting) that the characters in the video would converge to a point at the end. 
But then it hit me hard...our lives, yours and mine, are just converging only in our memories...in our own **mind-cave**s. 

It tells us a story of every one of us who is yearning for something in life...memories entangled with our future self...our current self just sits right somewhere out there, a lost soul waiting to be found again in the "yearning" of our future self!
