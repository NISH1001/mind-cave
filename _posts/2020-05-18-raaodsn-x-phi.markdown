A gentle breeze kisses me like it's last time  I'm around.

A white stripe of cream glued to the sky, frozen in time... as if it's gonna detonate.

Meanwhile, a large spaceship hovers nearby. As gray-colored lasers disembark on a peaceful journey, a Raven shines like a shooting star that's carrying the burden of the whole universe, as if the singularity is there strapped... Maybe trapped. No-one to observe... As if there's no distinction of reality and fantasy... As if there's no observer...

I take a ride on one of the floating bubbles around the singularity. "Nights in shining" played in the background like Goku riding on nimbus. Maybe star Lord. I'm not sure. A distant galaxy flashes in and out of the reddish vision, pulsating stars...

I'm on a warp drive with space filled with hopeless particles phasing in and out of existence. The [[Space-Time Continuum]] seems bizarre as if the creatures in my mind-cave will be brought back into this hallucinating reality. Maybe this isn't the reality but an imagination from a super-intelligent, cosmic being that's just dreaming in his pod like millions of him, under a stasis waiting for a better destiny outside of this galaxy. Maybe the destination galaxy is billions of parsec away. The ship may run out of fuel. However, there's a secondary engine powered by radiation that comes out when cosmic being like him goes under deep cryonics. The autopilot **[[QXZ-42]]** (commonly known as  **[[Raaodsn X-phi]]**) seems to know exactly what should be done -- keep the stasis running.


As the ship reaches the outer edge of Andromeda, there's some bizarre flickering of radiations in the secondary engine. Maybe a small percentage of those cosmic beings are under nightmare about warping through this crazy journey directed by a substitute mind. Maybe, they're being hit by strong virtual particles that have not been observed before by such sentient beings. Maybe...
