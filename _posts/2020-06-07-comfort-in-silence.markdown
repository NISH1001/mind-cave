> Not sure out of nowhere I feel like crying.


Life has been a little tipsy and more hazy lately.
Background is echoing with [To Jinda Ho Tum](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=To+Jinda+Ho+Tum+poetry)


> इक बात होंटों तक है जो आई नहीं
बस आँखों से है झांकती


As these soundless emotions and emotionless sounds pulsate with indefinite frequencies, I seem to phase in and out to other realities within my mind-cave.
There are certain thoughts that just can't be rendered into anything. And the more you cage those thoughts, they keep on enticing the creatures inside the mind-cave. I guess that's, yet, another metaphor for my life.

RIght now, I am trying to see where I failed in loving a person, how I flowed in love. I certainly miss Aurora. 
And the more I spent my silence in solitude, the more reverberations I can feel, that there at some corner of my heart I have that urge to get connected again, say everything I feel about her. 

I want to listen to her voice, all those rants she used to have, those intermittent mood swings, sometimes too caring, sometimes too "whiny"; above all looking at me like I am the only person in this world, like a tiny firefly that's alone flashing in daylight. 

I guess I want to feel "loved" romantically. 

It is true I guess that every first "true" sensation of romantic love is of a special kind. And that I want to flow again not like a river that knows its course in time, but like a paperboat floating around, unknown of the other unknowns, a little late and sometimes a little early. But whatever the destination is, it shouldn't be lonely.
