> For someone whom I met for a month+ but feels I have known her my entire life. Love is what the heart feels. :)

"Love"  
Don't ask me what love looks like.  
It's all right, it hasn't touched me yet  
For I have loved you a hundred times  
Among the stars that fail to shine  
For you,  
In between life and death  
I wished and could only wish you my life  
My heart doesn't beat much  
Like it used to  
I have grown old and cold  
Stuck in between what "love" means, what it meant  
and what it is meaning  


Don't ask me the color of "love"  
It doesn't speak much  
For I have loved you a hundred times  
Among the waves that wished to meet the shore  
Kissing, as each grain of sand disperses my feelings  
You stood there, trying to get hold of yourself  
I floated under the dark night, wishing to hold you  


Don't ask me what shape the "love" is.  
It's a missile I wish could detonate my soul  
Drawing out the most beautiful fractals  
Of our emotions  
It's a tree I wish I could plant in your heart  
A flower  
Like how bees carry pollens of my words to you  
Tiny fireflies shimmering  
That shines a glaze  
A drip of my emotions inside the honeycomb  
Don't ask me what shape the love is  
  
Don't ask me where love resides  
I wish it were in your heart  
In the sleeves you carry  
A little weird but fiery  
You sent me a beam of positivity  
It melted my heart  
Like some witchcraft  
I surrendered  
Little tipsy and a little smokey  
A puff of my emotions  
I floated among the winding texts  
My heart pressed  
Against the throbbing of your call  
I waited for my soul to fall  
For you among the stars  
That doesn't shine for us  
  
Don't ask me why love exists  
For I am just a traveler in your heart  
Navigating the vast landscape  
Of your smiles  
And anxiety attacks  
And often, wished to swallow a pill  
For you, so that it wouldn't kill  
You and end all your miseries  
Your suffering, I wish to drink 'em all  
You hid them all   
Beneath your angst  
Smiled a big smile at me  
Pressing against my migraine  
You ran a battle through voices   
A slow thump of my headache  
You listened to the silence  
That healed the pain  
  
"Inshallah" you kept on sending  
Smiles that ran across two thousand miles  
Clouds and the sun and the bird and the plane.  
And the cat.  
Rivers. Parks.   
I wish we were there.   
I wish you were here.  
I wish "here" was there.  
I wish "there" was here.  
I wish "here" was my heart.  
I wish heart was ours.  
I wish.  
  
I wondered if that's what love is  
I wonder if this is what love feels like  
What is love but not caring?  
What is love but not fearing?  
What is love but not daring?
