Tonight! I am not sad.  
Nor I am mad.  
I am expressionless.  
There’s nothing I have to express.  
There’s no desire at expense.  

-----

Tonight! I am a commoner.  
A Son — whose heart beats for his mother.  
A Child — dreams all stout  
A Brother — sister’s hopes echo aloud  
A Neighbour — lively yet mysterious  
A Citizen — responsible, inglorious  
A no one — lurking in the shadow  

-----

Tonight! I am a friend  
A faceless in the circle  
Independent — lost in thoughts  
Of love, life and arts  
Some reasons to live  
None clinging to another’s dream  

-----

Tonight! I am a pedestrian  
Wandering around, feeling the rain  
A Walker — indifferent yet significant  
A Watcher —looking beyond the blurred lens  
A Thinker — lost in dreams  
Of silence and screams.  
A Painter — filling the imagination  
With life and thoughts  
Still, I am no one rushing around.  

-----

Tonight — It’s special.  
I’m on a date — with Peace and Chaos  
No emotions — I am expressionless  
Tonight! I am in search of myself.  
A someone — a face under the mask  
A traveller through time  
A wanderer through life.  
A stargazer — in awe of vastness         
Of life and emptiness.
