This is a a poem from my journal entry of April 2020. I don't know why I am back again to this poem.  
Probably it represents my solitude?  
Or perhaps this also reminds me that adulthood is starting to suck, as if I am locked in my mind-cave...a very naive bubble.  

I am not sure. Probably it's also a tribute to inevitableness of loneliness.  

Or perhaps, it's also about the existential terror of death. Reminds me of Sheldon Solomon's [Terror Management Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_management_theory).  

> *Modern culture abstracts death away by convincing us that we are living a meaningful universe and who individually contributes to that universe in a significant way seems to postpone the fear.* - [The Mind, Life & Work of Sheldon Solomon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUtLHR5v7y4)

Perhaps, I can only speculate through a telescopic lens from future to the past; the pass reflects back at the present.


In its entirety, it's about this unwavering emptiness in my life. [The Void](https://nish1001.github.io/mind-cave/poetry/the-void.html) is real and strong.

Anyway, I am glad that I have turned this poem into a psychedelic poetry:

Somewhere among the shadows  
A silence lurks  
As the light flickers within you  
It breaks  
In the emptiness that holds  
The cracks  
The misty morning mourns  
For you  
The sun phases out in the storms  
And disappears...  
  
You are lost among the gentleness  
Of breeze  
Flowing into the crevices  
Like bees  
Humming songs that don't echo  
Into your eyes  
A mellow light enters  
In.  
There's no out.  
Trapped.  
The moon phases out into the clouds
And disappears...
