# Mystified

"Life"  
A four-letter word  
That encompasses the  
"umm..."  
and the "hmmm..."  
Inside a holed straw  
Where you sip the elixir  
Of the unknowns.


"Love"  
A four-letter word  
That mystifies your knowns  
Of the feelings that aren't yours...  
You try to grab it by the roots  
Each gasp elapses  
In the lapse that you drown...  



"Time"  
A four-letter  
Fills the straw with dreads  
Of the lives and the dead  
You grab it in a withered land  
Like a ticking sand on your palm 
It passes by  
Within the empty cracks  
Connects your life...  



"What"  
A four-letter question  
Wrapped up in never-ending cycles  
Of the "why" and "how".  
When the time follows back  
To the rhythms of the sands  
You held like your love  
bewildered...  



"Heart"  
A five-letter word ticks...  
But sometimes,  
Skips 
A beat  
Disentangled,  
In time  
and emotions...  
A song of the yearning  
echoes in the distant  
mellows  
That fills the straw  
You sipped through.  

Mystified.  
Forever you are  
In the timeless lands  
Made of sands  
Withering away.  
A grain drops by,  
You weigh it down  
With a puff from your cigar.  


Your life,  
sinks  within the corals  
Of emotions  
And closures  
you try to hold them down  
With the broken straw  
That made up the letters and the questions  
Within the muddled dreams  
Time screams...  
And you disappear...  
Like the sand you tried to hold.  
You are the stream of sand on the beach  
Washed up. Bewildered...forever...and ever...  
..and ever...and ever...  
...and ever...
