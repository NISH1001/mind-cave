Sometimes...  
Sometimes I feel my head is the sun  
Where rest of the world revolves around  
Too close, you get burn  
Too far,  you get shunned  
Somewhere, lies a Goldilocks region  
The place of mindful creation  
The place of self destruction  

Sometimes my mind is a black hole  
Where the voices never echo  
Your images projected  
Like a theory of holographic universe  
But this time, it's the people and their curses  
Their inner demons blessed with bruises  
Of the battles fought within themselves  
Egos and Modesty revolving selfishness  
Like twin stars  
Dancing with each other  
Around a star  
That has never let you escape  
Spiraling around and around and around and around...  
The harmony attenuates  
To this lifeless part  
The universal art!  
  
Sometimes...  
It's amazing  
It's amazing to even be a black hole.  
Thoughts come in and never escape  
You try to accelerate and go full throttle  
But there's no return  
You try to boost with extra fantasies  
With the escape velocity  
You had never imagined existed  
Like a timeless entity  
Pulling you to its core  
Beyond its event horizon  
You are gone...  
I guess you are gone in parts  
  
Sometimes...  
Sometimes I wish I were a supernova nearing its death  
Where the explosion creates a surge of emotions  
A sudden gamma burst  
That inflicts philosophical wounds  
To your inner Bruce Baner  
Where a new hulk is about to emerge.  
But this time, he's calmer!  
  
Sometimes...  
Sometimes I feel like an electron  
All charged with these negative charges  
Ready to electrocute the world around  
All you have to do is let me flow  
Let my inner demons burn and glow!  
  
Sometimes I feel like a gluon  
A strong force  
That helds conflicting thoughts together  
Like protons and neutrons in the same cage  
Giving each other a part of their support  
Unaware of their own purpose!  
The inner quarks  
Quack  
Silently  
with emptiness...  
  
Sometimes...  
Sometimes among the **POWERS OF TEN**  
I feel like a binary switch turning ON and OFF  
The parts of which doesn't make sense  
The whole creates essence with its presence!  
The world is empowered!  
  
Sometimes I wish I was as hypothetical as Deep Thought could be  
Where hitchhikers around the galaxy come and ask  
**"Hey! What's the meaning of YOUR LIFE, YOUR UNIVERSE AND YOUR EVERYTHING"**  
And I compute there silently and reply back  
**"ZERO DIVIDED BY INFINITY"**  
Because I am not sure what my limits are...  
  
At other times I feel like an incompleteness theorem  
Lurking around, here and there in forums  
Of Reddit, Stackexchange, Quora  
And YouTube comments  
Nobody gets it  
But everyone enjoys the existential crisis  
Of axioms and logic  
  
  
But often...  
Often I feel like a tree in the forest  
The world of eternal solitude  
A tree  
That is about to fall  
Or has fallen  
The echo of which you will never hear...  
I ask a question to the universe:  
**"If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"**  
The universe sits silently  
Staring at me  
Right through my soul  
Gives me a silent gaze  
Doesn't reply back  
Everything crumbles to nothingness  
Like it was before  
Can you hear?
