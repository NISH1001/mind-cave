[March 06, 2021. 19:02. On the roof...phasing in and out...Listening to music...Thinking...]

I am not sure how I am coping with my loneliness. Today feels like yesterday. Maybe exactly like a week back, cozy...reading shit from the interwebs.

Maybe today was a month ago. Maybe a year back except there's no one right now. **"Now"** might have been a different future. . but it feels like a broken past...

It's a weekend..yet it feels like any other day here in my mind-cave. I rewatched Avengers Age of Ultron. Watched the season finale of wandavision. Read some threads off the Hacker News...and a few pages from 2 current books: The myth of Sisyphus and Ways of Seeing... Also slept for an hour or so.

This is absurd. I have no idea where my life is drifting...or what my life is drifting at...

Listening to the **“All I've Ever Known”** by Bahamas... I just wish this river doesn't end at a waterfall now. I don't have energy to take that fall...let alone no resistance...


Thinking about grad school is also giving me anxiety again. Only 3 colleges I've applied to..and I guess I don't have even 1% of hope..


Karen Dalton’s [Take Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqTFKSI0Zgo) hits hard right now. I'm on the roof swaying with the beat...as the breezes beat my hair...a plane flies... Its destination is fixed. How I wish mine was too... As the light flickers in the distance....fades away...I guess I have to fade away now... Oh the irony of "now" juxtaposed with this mind-cave...

Micah P Hinsons’ [“Beneath The Rose”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61ydLNyrX4M) resonates strongly...

> It is said  
That you cannot be found  
Under rocks or broken skull  
I will lay down  
I will lay down  
I can be found beneath the rose  
Beneath the rose  
Alone
