The first time I saw her, she was roaming around **the forbidden area**. Obviously, I was surprised since she wasn't a hologram. She was as real as I was, wandering with my flesh.

Just when the twin suns began to disapear among the barrier high above, I was there for maintenance. I was assigned to detect the anomalies in the chamber.

The chamber was keeping the barrier up and running. But a few days ago, some regions showed weird flickering. (I will write those details later.)

Yes. I saw the girl. Her appearane was familiar. I am sure I had seen her somewhere.

That afternoon felt weird. Bcause during the maintainance time, nobody were allowed to use any devices.

You see, the year is 3142 in your **human years**. For us, it's around 9143 relative to our **Twin Stars**. We have long merged with technology what you human call **cyborg**.

The dyson sphere is one of the major sources for us. However, sometimes due to proximity of **The Twins**, there occurs unusal activities where the radiations are very low. In that case, we are dependent on **this planet** as a source.

This planet is our main base to maintain the dyson sphere. We have an artificial core at the planet's heart that helps to keep up the barrier.

The barrier floats between the upper atmosphere and the dyson spheres.
The atmosphere is highly densed with Tritium.
This barrier helps to redirect most of the radiations from the Twins into other satellites.

#### Where was I?
Oh yes. I was assigned as the watcher along with 13 other groups scattered around the planet.

It was weird to see the girl. Because, besides maintenance, all the natives were moved to the nearby satellite, **QXZ-31**, also called [Raaodsn X-phi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2na3cUlB8wQ) by the natives.

These natives call refer us as **The Outsider**.

Siince we have the ability to merge with technology, we are allowed to come to this planet in our virtual form.

We temporarily clone our consciousness into a cluster of entangled particles which we refer to as **"UNK-IV**. It has been the safest mode of teleportation for us since we don't actually use our own physical form.

Coming back to the girl, I think it was a **girl**. I am not sure. She was physically present on the site. I didn't report the incident.

I followed the trail. My **Geiger counter** was showing off-the-chart readings. The numbers were flickering wildly. That provided me a way to follow **her**.

However, I didn't follow her physically. I entangled myself with the **UNK-IV** and kept the chase. For some reasons, no matter how hard I tried, I was always behind her.
When I reached one of the secondary artificial cores, she suddenly disappeared.
