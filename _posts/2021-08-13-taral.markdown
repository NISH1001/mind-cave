This week has been stressful. A lot of distractions has been a new form of coping mechanism.

**_"Umer"..."afai ma harayeko chu...kaha cha santulan..."_** Bartika's soft voice echoes... I'm listening to her after a long time. The song is one of my favorites... Takes me to the hidden streets of the memory lane.

It's chilling out here. I don't know why I take life seriously... When did I smile honestly last time? When did I truly enjoy my life? "Why" is the only question that I have... Distractions over distractions over distractions. I don't even want to think about grad schoolâ€¦

Bartika's voices whisper in this empty night. Moon is half-assed in the sky. No breezes today, but it's chilling out here. Not sure what neighbours are thinking looking at a guy on a top of roof looking at the screen ...




**_"Tini ra, Ma"_**. Haven't listened to this song in a long time.. I have really lost all the good sensation of 'being loved'. Life's a fragile piece of paper. Perhaps it's too much fluid..

Silence. I can hear crickets in the backdrop. Why is there a great silence in life? Why is it that I get inspiration from the great struggles of life? Despite having now been somewhat comforting to live this life...
