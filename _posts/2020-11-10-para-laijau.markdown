It's lonely out here in this spaceship flying through weird radiations. Now. Right here. At this moment. When you see this, the spaceship might have swept a few parsecs of the outer edge of an unknown galaxy. Probably, it will have been too late when you get this. Whatever it is, loneliness persists and every other algorithm in the mainframe computer has been a distraction, away from that loneliness.

There's no [HAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be8Gbqdox68).
There isn't [Wall-E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8LrCWmGYw) here.
They have long shut down because of insufficient power in the spaceship. The main chamber is already dead. I am relying on the secondary engine. NOt sure how long it will last. All I can do is hope. Yes, I can only hope.

I guess "hope" is the only thing that ties us to our own weird existence. Other than that, what good is it to hurl through this deep space, unknown of destination?

I guess, your spaceship is also somewhere, in some another distant galaxy and this communication is the only thing that's keeping up the weird entanglement.

I guess these letters have become another form of habit that comes straight away, to give my loneliness a new life. You can imagine me with a weird cybernetic body, listening to the song....contemplating an ever-growing crisis...

I hope no one's gonna here, this far. I don't see any planets. Only asteroids hitting a few parts of the spaceship. But, rest assured, when you read this I'll be long gone through that asteroid "field". Just hope that the secondary engine doesn't give up.

Last time in this spaceship clock, I peeked out of this little window beside me. I saw a beautiful light as if I was hallucinating... That fleeting seemed like an eternity..had me remember an aurora of someone...That's that.

I think I will have to turn my body off, for now, to save power, although my mind can wander around.

To the infinity and beyond,
