In the distant darkness  
You cannot feel me.  
You cannot touch me.  
Can you see me?  

Like a dark shadow  
#following you in a meadow  
Phasing in and out  
of your existence  
Haunting your mind  

Like a horizon  
that is stretched  
Beyond imagination  
And broken sensation  

Like a wanderer  
Zooming here and there  
Without any destination  
And action  

Like an Untold story  
Chasing reality  
Phasing in and out  
of living  

Like a blank paper  
Floating in the air  
Without any hope  
and desire  

Like a caterpillar  
In a cacoon  
Emerging with  
beautiful color  


I am an observer  
You cannot see  
With your eyes  

In your dreams  
I crawl and scream  
Into your mind  
Like a parasite  
Eating you inside out...
