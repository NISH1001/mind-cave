What is a hell?  
The tolling of the bell?  
Or is it just a reality  
That’s been trolled?  
An impose one  
Deep beneath is none…?  


What is a truth?  
The lies through the tooth?  
Or just an imposed shit  
That you just bit…?  


The very imposed words,  
Stabbing every minds  
Nothing seems real  
Yet you can steal  
Into the unknowns,  
The you, THE HUMANS  
They impose  
They lose  
None is the one,  
Never is the world,  
None shall speak  
The genuine truth  
Behind all the truths  


It’s an imposed one  
They impose   
You impose  
I impose  
They lose  
You lose  
I lose  
THE HUMANLY FOOLS…
