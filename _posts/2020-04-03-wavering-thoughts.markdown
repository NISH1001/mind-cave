*मैं पल दो पल का शायर हूँ। पल दो पल मेरी कहानी है*

> April 03, 2020. Been almost 2 weeks with the lockdown due to COVID-19. It’s scary. The virus has a growth rate of almost 2. That means, it grows exponentially.

I have been trying to refrain myself from [negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32MiAPR2S4g){:class="paradox"} thoughts, not writing my thoughts into any journal entry or notes. 
I am experimenting on how I can sedate my anxieties and crises. Right now Sisan Baniya’s [vlog](https://youtu.be/VOp01zZwSGg?t=1549) is being played in the background. 
These past few weeks I had been trying to focus myself on learning new things, reading good contents, and above all focusing my research on computer vision for the startup I am currently engaged in. 
Me and my colleague were able to implement a paper from scratch for detecting table-like structure from a document image. 
We have our own version of implementations for the paper. 
The results are turning surprisingly good with the detector. 
Today, I was able to merge the experimental code into an independently working framework.  


Other than that nothing’s new. 
Oh yeah! I have started doing calisthenics again. 
I have form a “proper” habit of going to bed early and waking up early. 
I think that’s good for me, especially with the lockdown in place. 
I was planning to start my personal newsletter (for which I had started compiling things but failed once again!). 
I guess just like other things, it will be procrastinated!


I have been partly successful in not [overthinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwhsXSh5OHI){:class="paradox"} much. 
I guess. Yeah, I guess! That’s how life has been. 
Just guessing about the unknowns, how it is going to be in future times to come, looking back at which I might have some other type of interpretation. 
Just imagine yourself in a future version of your own “self” that’s writing about the past. 
Your future and the past getting tangled in some mysterious ways. 
That’s what I feel about writing. 
It has been a way of my life I guess, since I have almost no one to talk to that can just sit here right beside me and just listen; listen like there’s no tomorrow. 
Like the world’s gonna end in a nuclear apocalypse. 
Whenever I start writing, these sorts of thoughts just keep on flowing like there’s an uncanny river being blocked by walls of wavering stones! I guess I am starting to waver now, drifting in a rabbit hole of life being fragmented among the vastness.
