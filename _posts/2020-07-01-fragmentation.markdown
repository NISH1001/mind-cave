The poem is an ode to absurdly fragmented reality of mine.

---

Currently it's about to hit 10pm. I am listening to **Space Age Love Song** by **A Flock Of Seagulls**.


I was feeling lonely today. Yesterday night I had another anxiety attack. 
This morning I had a terrible headache. So, I had to take a leave from work to fix myself up. 
Half of "today" passed by in fragmented tasks of reading, playing guitar and contemplating things, yet again. 

Suddenly, I started to feel very anxious. Most probably because of the unknowns of life itself. 
Still I need some validation check sometimes. 
I need a reality check about myself that I am a sucker for almost everything. 
And at times like these I keep on looking back at a few allegories from Kafka and DFW. Kafka's poseidon and David's depressed person. 
When I look at things, they don't even make sense. Not sure how long these absurdities are going to hug me; tame the creatures in my mind-cave.  


I feel alienated most of the time. Sometimes, I talk to Bijay and Bibus. They seem to be the only 2 persons right now I talk sometimes. 
But then, they have their own sets of "crises". Their own life.
I am sure they feel this way too. 
And I can't always lean on someone or something to keep me sane enough to "breathe" and validate myself.

Lately, I have started to develop same state like a paper boat, floating in a puddle. 
No matter how big or small it is, it's simply whirling here and there. 
At times like these, I often tend to just be with nature. See the sky. Float among the clouds. Gaze at "starry" birds. Chirping.  

And sometimes, I feel like holding my pen and just write. So, I wrote something while trying to kiss my solitude. 
A tribute to myself. A reminder that life is fragmented.

> It's 7 pm again  
Flags in the distant horizon  
Keep on waving  
Goodbyes or hellos?  
Does it matter?  
Sound of falling water  
Is empty  
But I hear my guitar  
Moaning. Lonely.  
A red bottle  
Full of fluctuating dreams  
Crowded skies  
With creams  
And empty wishes  
Trapped.  
Unfulfilled.  


> Leaves fiddle  
Here and there  
Somewhere. Nowhere.  
Missing aura  
Someone's air  
Birds in murmuration  
Trapped at the orange sky  
One slides left  
Others follow in haste.  
My eyes in temptation  
Dispersion.  
Fragmentation.
